"10/12/2021","Jennifer Mayhew","5","Helpful and Informative From first receiving the advice from Nationwide Claims Service, the instructions and advice were clear and helpful.

I am glad that you went ahead and proceeded with the claim, so that we could send the funds to you - Maurice"
"09/10/2021","Timothy Ball","5","Out of the Blue, received a communication re lost monies. I rang Nationwide and discussed the subject. I expanded the search and then waited. Nationwide herded all the relevant authorities et al. Some took their time. I received a handsome cheque for monies that I would not have received without Nationwide's service. Fantastic.","09/13/2021","Hi Timothy I smiled when I read your response as the word 'herded" was a very accurate description. You had funds with several government departments and it was somewhat complicated for us behind the scenes. Our aim was to keep it as simple as possible for you, so hopefully it wasnt too bad for you - Maurice"

They have promptly and consistently answered all my questions and gave good quality of advice on what documentation I needed and what my expectations should be on a payout. All round worth my 5 star rating.","09/13/2021","Thanks Philip for your great review. We were fortunate that you were able to find a connection to the old PO Box from 20 years ago.

"08/23/2021","Roger Colman","5","These guys found my money that , to be perfectly honest, I had forgotten about. I value my personal time at around $100 per hour, so for me to collect appraise and learn all the processes to reclaim money , added up to more than Nationwide's commission . So I used them. The only hassle to to collect all the information 100%, tick off each item that you have completed, and then they do it. Its a discipline I would not have had by self motivation. Roger Colman","09/13/2021","Hi Roger What a great review you have provided! You are one of the few to have recognised that what we do is very challenging. All 10 government departments who have unclaimed money have different requirements and claim forms. I am so fortunate to have the staff we have, for they are very smart but also process focused. I am glad you have had the benefit of the work we do - Maurice"

"08/02/2021","Del McDougall","5","Absolutely the best service. All done in a very professional and helpful way.I did not begrudge the percentage they charged for finding the money for me, in fact it could have been higher, and I would have happily paid what ever they asked.","09/13/2021","Hi Del. I will bear that in mind for next time we recover money owing to you (just joking). It was a pleasure being able to work with you in recovering the funds - Maurice"

"07/21/2021","Brian Mitchell","5","Like anyone when you are offered money from unclaimed funds now held in govt accounts you become sceptical to say the least. However I had full satisfaction with my dealings with NCS and they exceeded my expectations and especially the help offered by Maurice in obtaining the return of these funds. Brian Mitchell","07/23/2021","Hi Brian I can understand why you would be uncomfortable receiving a letter offering to send you some money. Sounds too good to be true! Thanks for adding your voice to the chorus of others who have described their satisfaction about what we do. Maurice"
"07/20/2021","Barry MOORE","5","Nationwide Claims Service win Gold,Gold,Gold :-) Recently I was contacted by Nationwide Claims Service regarding my being a possible recipient of an amount acquired in a share portfolio from many years ago. I was completely unaware that such funds were in fact owed to me.  The letter received provided a step by step guide as to the process required to reply. I provided info that I could and after a few weeks I received a letter seeking added info required in order to provide proof I was the person who was the actual recipient of the funds in question.  I was aware that this was a genuine means of connecting people with lost and or forgotten monies as after receiving the initial letter, I carried out a search of Nationwide Claims Service on Google to satisfy myself that they were a legitimate business dealing in such maters. The reviews I read were all I needed to know to satisfy myself that they were indeed a registered business, which was supported by many other past recipients who were in a similar position to myself.  I received a final letter of completion of the process along with the amount in question attached. The entire process from start to finish was of the highest satisfying, and professional standard applied by Nationwide Claims Service.  This was indeed welcomed after not knowing the funds even existed.  I did not receive any such letters from any other business that does similar work. As Nationwide Claims service were the first ( and only ) firm to contact me, I was satisfied of their professional approach and that they were to be rewarded by my agreeing to them acting on my behalf.  I applaud Nationwide Claims Service and would have no hesitation in recommending them to other people who may receive such a letter as I did, as by saying yes to them, them you have struck Gold.  Thank you NATIONWIDE CLAIMS SERVICE and I wish you great success in the future as you connect people with monies which comes as a great surprise, particularly in these difficult times we all currently face.  Cheers and thanks again.

"07/17/2021","Lee Reid","5","Out of the blue I got an email saying I… Out of the blue I got an email saying I was owed money. At first I thought SCAM! But then remembered I did indeed have the shares to the company that went into receivership. I didn't give bank details and about a month later received a cheque.","07/23/2021","Hi Lee I want you to know that I appreciate that you took the time to leave a review on our services. That is why in the letter we provide as much detail as we have access to, so that you know if the money belongs to you. We are also very conscious of protecting our client's information, which is why we do not ask for bank details. The only exception to this is for our NZ customers where NZ banks have stopped accepting cheques. A bank transfer is our only option. Have a great day - Maurice"

They persisted when I was ready to give up, and the funds came through due to their persistence.","06/03/2021","Hi Hugh Yes your claim was a little more difficult than usual. Proving your connection to the address was challenging as the documents you had didn't fit what the government normally expects. However you got there and we were able to convince them that you were the right person. Good outcome for everyone - Maurice"

"05/20/2021","Timothy & Linda Rutledge","4","national claims service did us a big service gathering $2000. we did not we had as we had left the industry before the wool company was disbanded. The governments of the day are nothing but thiefs. we thank national claims service & they earned their commision.","06/03/2021","Thanks Timothy & Linda. You are not alone in your opinion of what happened to the wool growers around the year 2000. That it took until this long for the assets to be sold and so many farmers have since passed away. I am glad we have been able to recover all the funds we could for you - Maurice"

Recovering money from the government is something very few would have done before whereas we do it all day, every day for the last 12 years.

A lot of that comes from having staff who have worked here for many years and we have accumulated a considerable amount of knowledge. I am so pleased that we have been able to use this experience to be able to claim funds for you from the government - Maurice"

"05/02/2021","julian gold","5","Absolutely honest and transparent. Highly recommended Around 12 months ago I started to receive letters from various companies offering to get money back for me from banks and ASIC. I was very sceptical so I tried to do it myself. Very frustrating and unsuccessful. I decided to use Nationwide Claims and, after checking the reviews, I spoke with Maurice Pratt, who is the main person. I provided my information and Nationwide has been excellent. In fact they even discovered funds I did not know about. They kept me up-to-date every few weeks. They were extremely honest and tenacious about following up various banks and they eventually achieved total success. The fee they charged is very reasonable and everything is completely transparent and up front. Highly recommended.","05/05/2021","Thank you Dr Gold for your comprehensive review. We value your thoughts as it helps others make wise decisions as to which unclaimed money agent they should use. It was a pleasure to work with you and we will contact you if there is any additional funds that become owing to you - Maurice"

"04/27/2021","Happy Clients","5","Thank you so much for your assistance. When we initially received correspondence (letter in the mail) we were concerned it was a scam.

You kept us up to date on where things were at all the time. I highly recommend your business and service.","05/05/2021","Hi. I am so pleased that you are happy with the work that we do.

These days the financial industry is so broad that it is difficult for advisors to be a specialist in every area. This is our space and we do this all day, every day. For the average member of the public, it would be very difficult to know who is providing the right advice. That is why I appreciate your thoughts on your experience so that others can be confident that we will do the right thing by them too - Maurice"

It is good to be a little skeptical these days, especially when someone is offering you money! That is why we tell you as much as possible such as the name, old address and who the money came from. That helps you to work out if it all makes sense. That is also why your review is so important as it tells your story of what it is like to work with us. That we are honest and trustworthy, professional and treat our customers how we would like to be treated. All the very best - Maurice"

"03/19/2021","Kevin Baldock","5","Nationwide Claims Service found money that we were not aware of.They paid by cheque so no bank details were involved","04/20/2021","Hi Kevin. We love our job where we recover money for people, most of whom don't know they have it owing to them. I guess it is a bit different to most businesses and therefore not what people expect. Hence it is understandable for them to want to be careful. So thanks for telling your story and how it worked out for you - Maurice"

Most people do not realise how difficult (and expensive) it is find people these days. We used to just look up the phone book but these days with most people not having landlines and not in the directory, we have to use a private investigator to find their latest address. I am glad we have been able to keep finding money for you. It is certainly better in your pocket than the government's! All the very best - Maurice"
"03/17/2021","Aileen Martin","5","I received notification from Nationwide Claims Service that they had found money owing to me. Usually, when this hss occurred previously I had to provide stat decs etc and it wad quite a hassle. With Nationwide it was very simple, they did all the work for me and I received the money i within a short period of time. Very happy with them.","03/17/2021","Hi Aileen As much as we would like to take credit for the smooth process, it does depend on which government department is holding your funds. Your funds were with a department that is not too onerous to work with. Having said that, even when there is a Stat Dec to fill out, we do as much as we can for you, so you only have to sign it. It is all about making the process as easy as possible for you. Glad it has worked out so well for you - Maurice"
"03/17/2021","Joe M","5","Suspected a scam initially, but everything turned out ok and I received my money that had been held by NSW gov since 1974. Very happy with outcome Joe M","03/17/2021","Hi Joe It is good that you are careful. I can see why people would be suspicious when they receive a letter advising that they have money owing to them. That is why we ask ALL our clients to provide feedback so that others can read of their experience and then have the confidence that we will always do the right thing by them. All the very best - Maurice"
"03/11/2021","Elizabeth Graham","5","Totally impressed! At first I thought it was a scam but I googled the business & it seemed legit. I liked that I didn't have to provide bank details.

"03/10/2021","Judy","4","Would have scored 5 stars if FULL amount of monies owing was paid to Robert, as he was and still has 100% of said trust fund, despite Genders and then my name on title. I was concerned re the amount of confidential paperwork that was required in order to receive what is rightfully Robert’s, however, I believe all paperwork has now been shredded. Mr Maurice Pratt was helpful and professional in his advice with this process.","03/10/2021","Hi Judy As much as we would have loved to apply for and send Robert the full amount of money, the funds were in joint names with Robert and Mr Genders. Unfortunately as we are unable to contact him, we were only able to apply for Robert's half. Yes I can confirm that I personally shredded all Robert's personal documents as soon as we made the payment. All the best - Maurice"

I recommend this company. Thank you!","03/03/2021","Hi Kathleen Thank you for taking the time to leave such a positive review.

Many of our client's are older folk, so our default payment method is by cheque. However if a client says they want a bank transfer, we are more than happy to do this. At the end of the day, it is all about giving our clients what they want. All the best - Maurice"

Would highly recommend them for any funds that need claiming.","03/03/2021","Hi David Thanks for the recommendation! A simple process I can take credit for however as for the paperwork, it really comes down to what government is holding the funds and what they are willing to accept to prove the money belongs to you.

When I got the last letter ( not from Nationwide Claims ) I looked on line and found Maurice’s details so I contacted him. I was very sceptical at first but everything he told me was true .","03/08/2021","You are wise to be financially wary in this era of scams. This is one of the prime reasons that we engaged the services of Trustpilot, in order to provide evidence of clients who have successfully used and subsequently reviewed our services, to our potential clients. Our current score of 4.8 out of 5 from over three hundred reviews is clear evidence of our integrity and efficiency. Regards. Maurice."

"02/17/2021","Andrew","5","Was worth the wait Excellent service provided by Maurice and the team I was surprised to find out my late father, passing 10 years earlier had accumulated some shares, unfortunately he didn't have a will and that made it very difficult to obtain by myself as next of kin. With the help and guidance of Maurice and the team it was a slow lengthy process through the banking industry and governments red tape. Patience was required and in the end the result was a neat financial sum shared by the family Thanks so much","03/08/2021","Thank you Andrew for your honest appraisal of our service. We are fortunate to have in our employ a Consultant with thirty seven years experience dealing with deceased estates, who is able to provide guidance in the more complex estate matters.

Otherwise we would have offered the option of a bank transfer. As you live in NZ and the cheque was issued by an Australian bank, the banks will take about 3 weeks to clear the funds. Frustrating to both of us - Maurice"

"01/29/2021","Janine Milton","4","A professional service We had some unclaimed funds from my father's deceased estate. NCS was very thorough in their due diligence to ensure we were legitimate claimants. We received letters and phone contacts- all of which were courteous and polite. We received the funds in the way they had explained with appropriate documents for taxation purposes. Although all this took time and we had to provide numerous documents, it was a very professional service that I would not hesitate to use again.","02/01/2021","Hi Janine I really appreciate the glowing feedback you took the trouble to leave for us. The government has very strict requirements for deceased estates to ensure that the funds are sent to the rightful beneficiaries. Our job is to guide you through the process and ensure that the documentation submitted is correct. Thank you for your patience and we will continue to monitor if any more funds become available - Maurice"
"01/29/2021","Biagio & Deborah Losordo","5","I received two cheques from Nationwide Claim Service from unclaimed funds from a shares investment. Process was a little slow because of COVID19 and Christmas holiday period but communication during the entire claim process was excellent.","02/01/2021","Hi Biagio & Deborah I am glad you have received the funds. Yes you are right about the amount of time it took the government to process the claim. Unfortunately the department holding your funds has only 1 person working in it and Covid 19 & Christmas had a big impact on getting the claim approved. But we got there and you now have the funds which is what matters. All the best - Maurice"
"01/19/2021","CM","5","Outstanding service Thinking it was a scam, I kept my letter from Nationwide Claims for about 6 months before acting on it. I eventually talked to my lawyer and they advised to confirm the Australian company registration number and also ring Nationwide Claims to have a chat with someone. The reg. number checked out and I then spoke to Maurice from Nationwide Claims, who was extremely forthcoming in the phone chat, advising which company the funds originated and how they ended up with the Australian government - and it all made sense given my work history. He followed up with a personalised email, I sent through the documents and the whole process from their end took (not even) 3 weeks - and that was through the Christmas period as well. This was the best service I have received from a company in a long time and still can't believe the funds are now in my bank. It's like winning Lotto :-) Thank you Maurice and co. - what a great job you do!","01/19/2021","Thanks Carolyn for your great review. I really appreciate you taking the time to leave such a comprehensive description of your experience. I loved the part where you said "This was the best service I have received from a company in a long time".

I am thrilled that we have exceeded your expectation and that we have achieved a great outcome for you - Maurice"

I trusted the Information and within 3 weeks over $5k was in my bank account, perfect timing right before Xmas.  So if you’re thinking it’s a scam like I did, believe me, it’s not and you will be happy to know there are unclaimed money available to you..  I received honest information and the process was easy, thank you for your help in cloning back money I had no idea was owed to me....  Tabatha, Perth, WA","01/19/2021","Hi Tabatha. You are right, it can be very difficult these days to know who to trust. That is why we provide as much detail about the source of the funds so that you can have confidence the funds do belong to you. Still, it is always good to be careful which is why we use this platform for people to describe their experience. So thanks for adding to the chorus of voices. All the very best - Maurice"

The only problem is that their fees are significantly higher than equivalent services. However they do match competitors and when they do they are the best to use.","01/08/2021","Hi Ian Yes we have had a long term relationship. One of the benefits we provide is that we monitor for any additional money that becomes owing to you, which is why we contacted you again recently to recover the second amount. Otherwise there is a chance that the funds will not be recovered. You are right that there are other competitors who have significantly less experience than we have (and potentially less quality).

We recovered the funds owing to you however made a mistake by sending you a cheque instead of doing a bank transfer (your note saying you wanted a bank transfer was missed by two of us).

We were nervous at first but Maurice and his team were always on hand to answer any questions and explain the procedure. It was a very efficient, transparent and amazingly easy process - once we had provided all the necessary documentation we just waited until NCS confirmed our cheques were in the mail - couldn't have been easier. In our experience NCS are a thoroughly trustworthy, honest and ethical company and we wouldn't hesitate to engage their services again in the future.","12/09/2020","Hi Ian Thankyou for the fantastic review.

The government department holding your funds is now taking 6-8 weeks to process the claims. It is frustrating to all of us as it used to only take 2 weeks! Once we submit the claim, we are dependent on them to process the claim. Each week we give them a list of clients we are waiting on funds for, to make sure they haven't forgotton any claims (yes it does happen). If you case, despite a number of phone calls and emails to them, they still took what we both feel is an unreasonable amount of time - Maurice"

John Woodward.","12/01/2020","Hi John. Thankyou for your feedback. I really appreciate you taking the time to leave feedback. After discussing your experience with you, it appears that we sent an initial letter to number 94 instead of 91 - it probably was a typo at our end. In regards to the recovery process being slow, you are 100% right, particularly when mail is sent between Australia & NZ. Then the government takes 28 days to process the claim. We do all we can to process it here in the office on the day it arrives but unfortunately the rest is out of our control .- Kind regards, Maurice"

Not their problem that my bank in NZ which happily takes cheques but takes six to eight weeks to process.","12/01/2020","Hi Shirley. We do have a bit of a conundrum with NZ clients. Most of our client's are older folk and prefer not to give out their bank details, so we send them a cheque. But as you have identified, the process to get the funds cleared from a cheque is extremely slow, and we know of one bank (Kiwibank) who does not even accept cheques. For those reading this, giving your bank details does not allow someone to take funds from your account. Just look at any business invoice for it will list the company bank details. Shirley I am so glad that we were able to help you - Maurice"

"09/21/2020","PHIL BREW","4","Just a lot to go through to get back my money, less the 22% of course. Proving I lived at my address from 25 years ago took some effort.  But Paula was great, very friendly and very professional. Australia Post weren’t exactly the most efficient, taking 2 weeks to receive my cheque in the mail was a bit of a concern but I guess during Covid times that is the new normal.  All good in the end. Thank you Nationwide Claims, the money couldn’t have come at a better time with finances being tight now.","10/21/2020","Hi Phil Thanks for your feedback and I agree with you 100%!  The government is very careful to make sure that the documents submitted prove that the money was yours - we wouldn't want them to give your money to someone else with the same name!  Paula is wonderful and I am very lucky to have her working for me.  Yes Australian Post frustrates us as well. It seems as though the delivery times are taking longer. Unfortunately I think that it will stay this way even after Covid.  I am glad that the outcome was successful for you and that you now have the money back.  Kind regards - Maurice"

You advised that many years ago you filled out a form for Computershare (who manages the shares that you owned) that you had a change of address. It appears they didn't action this and then sent a cheque to you at your old address. It was not banked and the funds were eventually sent to the government as Unclaimed Money.  NCS then found you at your current address and advised you that the funds were owing to you. We recovered those funds and sent them to you which you have deposited into your bank.  I am really glad to realise that the 3 star rating and comments relate to your overall experience from many years ago, not to the experience you have had with NCS. Verbally you advised that you WOULD recommend our services. Kind regards - Maurice"

Unlike some other Unclaimed Money Agents, Nationwide Claims Service doesn't just target the higher amounts owing to our clients, we actively seek to recover all of our clients lost funds. Kind regards Maurice"
"01/15/2020","Elizabeth Kettink","5","I had to ring you to remind you to get a previous address but I wouldn't have got any of the money if you hadn't gotten intoch so I changed the ratting","01/15/2020","Thank you Elizabeth for your valuable feedback. Unfortunately, when a client is unable to provide evidence of their connection to a former address, Nationwide Claims Service is able in some circumstances, to contact the source company and request a letter providing proof that the client's details for whom we are acting are a match with the details on their system. This does, however, place NCS in the situation of having to wait until the source company has the necessary available staff resources to provide this information. They do not charge for this service, and thus, the service provided can be at times, infrequent. In your situation, the source company had advised NCS that they were sending the required proof of connection for you, however they failed to send the letter. Your phone call was a timely reminder for us to follow up the source company to obtain the proof of connection to your former address, which enabled us to complete your claim. Kind regards Maurice"

It is almost unheard of for a client to leave anything other than a 4 or 5 star rating so I tried to call you to get for information. Unfortunately I had to leave a message and you have not called back.  Therefore I am unable to understand your situation and why you weren't completely happy like so many of our clients.

"11/20/2019","Bruce Brown","5","Nationwide Claims Service contacted my to inform me that there were funds that were possibly available to me, that were now being held by the government, due to some previous overcharging by a service provider. NCS assisted me through the process of obtaining the necessary documentation to enable a claim to be made. The personal information required of me was minimal and was not of any concern to me in disclosing this information. The intent to pay any funds available to me by cheque rather than bank transfer satisfied any scepticism I might have had. The claim was successful due largely to the efforts of NCS and I received the funds I was promised promptly by cheque.","11/20/2019","Thank you Bruce for taking the time to put your thoughts in writing. It sounds like you were very happy with your experience and that is ultimately what is most important to both of us. All the very best - Maurice"

Thanks for your feedback. You are 100% correct. To add to the information: when we applied for these funds, we were not aware that the government had just experienced serious staffing issues. Whereas it normally takes 3 weeks for them to process the claim, it took them 2 months.  There are a number of other clients who are still in your situation and your feedback has prompted us to send an update out to them by SMS. Thank you for your thoughts - Maurice"

I doubt if we would have been successful without their help. NWCS' attention to detail and their persistent negotiation with ASIC finally won the day. I highly recommend them if you have a need to deal with ASIC.","06/20/2019","Hi Anthony Yes I think this was your 3rd claim through us, although this was made somewhat challenging due to the number and location of the various trustees of your super fund as well as ASIC tightening up the documentation requirements. Thanks for your continued business and extraordinary patience. Regards Maurice"

We were a little skeptical at the start that they could recover the unclaimed dividend monies for us and there was quite a bit of paperwork required. However they were very professional and tenacious in following things through and we ended up with an excellent result - thank you.","06/20/2019","Hi Denis & Patricia Yes your claim was more difficult than most claims as you had funds with several government departments. While we were able to reuse your documents where we could, there was an application form for each department as well as a number of supporting documents relevant to your situation. I am glad that you were able to work through the requirements so that we could achieve the best outcome for you - Maurice"

"05/25/2019","Raymond Hardwick","3","Not impressed The process took far longer that it should have. The amount taken in fees was more than exorbitant to say the least.","05/27/2019","Hi Raymond. I am genuinely sorry that you were not impressed with our service. We did in fact go above and beyond in recovering your unclaimed funds: - sending you 2 complete sets of instructions - when you couldn't prove your connection to the old address, we personally contacted the company where the funds came from and provided the proof of address.  When you consider the extra work we went to to recover your funds, our fee was modest. In regards to the delay, this was caused by having to wait for the company to provide the document you couldn't, which can take up to a month for us to get. Maurice"

"05/06/2019","Geoffrey Spackman","5","Honest and professional During a major change in our lives which included moving house, we’d forgotten about an insurance policy we had. It turned out that the policy was bought by the CBA bank which gave us shares in the bank. Fifteen years later we were contacted by Maurice from Nationwide Claims telling us that he had found our shares and would sell them on our behalf if we so wished. We said “yes”. Three weeks later we had the cheque. We found Nationwide to be honest and very professional and I would throughly recommend Nationwide and Maurice, in particular to handle anyone’s claim.","05/08/2019","Thanks Geoffrey for your review. We work hard to make sure that your experience is as smooth and efficient as possible. Glad to see that we have exceeded your expectations - Maurice"

I am so grateful for the patience and diligence he displayed whilst I gathered the necessary documentation required to establish my identity.

I am glad we helped make your birthday that much more special! I know what you mean with the government bureaucracy. We deal with them all day every day! Your funds were held by ASIC who is VERY particular about the documentation however we work with them the most of all the 9 government departments.

However after a bit of background checking on the Company and on the circumstances, I decided to follow up. Maurice was extremely helpful in explaining the process and in providing the details about the owed money (which then made sense). I was impressed by the professionalism and the process ran like clockwork, resulting in me receiving a cheque in the described time-frame. A nice little bonus out of the blue.

"04/08/2019","Brenda Coleman","5","Great service and competitive commission. Nationwide Claims offered a very fair and competitive commission, they were very precise in what details were required from me, and once they had obtained all of them, I received my money within two weeks. The money was sent by cheque in the mail (which still hasn't cleared), so I personally would prefer a bank transfer. Also, I did need to phone them a couple of times to follow up on my claim (as they didn't receive one form, and my name was spelt incorrectly - so nothing was being done for weeks). However, as soon as I phoned them, they were extremely helpful, and continued with the claim that day. I highly recommend Nationwide Claims, compared to the other companies I spoke with. Overall, a very good experience.","05/02/2019","Hi Brenda. I appreciate your feedback you have provided, particularly about the choice of payment by bank transfer or cheque. We actually can deposit the funds into your account however we haven't really advised customers of the option. Therefore I will look at how we can update our instructions letters so that people can have a choice. Thank you for your excellent rating and we will continue to refine our processes to ensure that we can exceed expectations every time. - Maurice"

We are very mindful of what it can be like for our overseas clients given that the requirements are a little different to Australian based clients. This is why we make sure we are well versed in the requirements of the various government departments.

Thankyou very much.","03/20/2019","Hi Christine. Your claim was a bit more complicated than usual as you had funds with several government departments.

"03/12/2019","Wayne Drysdale","4","Would be good if the funds were paid directly into my bank account instead of receiving a cheque, I am not sure if this option was available and if it is/was I was unaware.","03/12/2019","Hi Wayne  Yes we can deposit the funds into a bank account if asked. The reason we send cheques by default is that many of our clients are older folk and they are nervous about sharing this information. So as a result we do not promote it as an option.  However your feedback is appreciated and I will reconsider if there is a way we can communicate this option without causing concerns."

You would have gained interest over the years.","02/05/2019","Hi Phillip  At no time does Nationwide Claims Service hold the funds or benefit from the interest. Your funds were held by the government in a Trust Account where it did accumulate interest which we passed on to you.  For you to determine how much interest that was paid, we sent you the two original remittance advices that we received from the government. The larger amount was the original funds that was owing to you and the smaller amount was the interest they paid you.  Our role was to recover the funds for you which we did, forwarding the funds to you within 2 days of receiving it.  Hope this explanation of the process helps you understand that your complaint is with the government, not with NCS.  Kind regards  Maurice"

The information about them and the Company NCS could be easily checked and confirmed , and I could cancel they services at any time . Overall ?

Yes I immediately thought this was a nasty scam but with research and a long chat with Paula NCS who explained how their service worked, why they existed and how they followed up for client's who obviously would have no idea they had unclaimed cheques in the State Revenue System I accepted their offer to reclaim on my behalf.  I was kept up-to-date throughout the five weeks and am so happy a great necessary service like this exists with such easy people to work with. It was much easier to pay them a small fee than State Renenue just taking my money. Thanks Guys","01/18/2019","Thanks Karen. We are so pleased that you love our work.  Yes you are right about if the money isn't claimed, most of the government departments take it. In your case it would have been gone after 7 years so that is why it is important to respond to the letter we send out. You would be surprised how often we get a call years later and the money has gone!  So we are really happy to connect you with the funds.  All the best - Maurice"

The staff we have here in the office are very knowledgeable, including one who has worked for the Public Trustee for 25 years.

Yes we have been doing this for many years and the accumulated knowledge makes the whole process easier for you. There are a few new agents out there who are learning as they go and that means they don't get it right the first time they submit the claim to the government.

Unclaimed Money Agents all work from the same databases so it is a good point that getting several letters quoting similar amounts is a good way to know that it isn't a scam. I say similar amounts with a little bit of caution as many agents only focus on one database not all nine like we do.  As you found, we do our upmost to do as much as we can to make it as easy as possible for you.  I am really pleased that this has been a great experience for you will pass your feedback on to the staff."

The great thing is that the company achieved the goal of having the funds paid to me, especially considering that my connection with a given address was very indirect.

They were also very good in keeping in touch, though at times I also had to initiate contact.","08/27/2018","Thank you Chris for providing your feedback.
